# Not-Approved-Programs-Jumpcloud
This script will send you an email notification when a not approved application is installed on a jumpcloud managed device. 

# HOW TO USE: 

1) Replace the 'X's on the email notification settings and the 'X' in the API key under 'headers' 
2) Fill out the 'approved_apps' list with your approved programs
3) Set the program to run in a 60minute interval on Task Schedueler


NOTE - You can edit interval to as slow as 15 minutes as the Jumpcloud agent reports directory insights every 15 minutes.
